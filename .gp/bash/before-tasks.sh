# Description:
# Tasks that should be run everytime the worspace is created or started.
# 
# Notes:
# Gitpod currently does not persist files in the home directory so we must write them 
# in everytime the workspace starts. This is done in the 'before' task in .gitpod.yml

# Load logger
. .gp/bash/workspace-init-logger.sh

# Aliases for git
msg="git aliases have been written"
bash .gp/bash/utils.sh add_file_to_file_after "\\[alias\\]" .gp/snippets/git/emoji-log ~/.gitconfig &&
bash .gp/bash/utils.sh add_file_to_file_after "\\[alias\\]" .gp/snippets/git/aliases ~/.gitconfig &&
log_silent "$msg" &&
log_silent "try: git a    or: git aliases to see what is available."

# Restore files marked as persistant such as workspace-init.log
# See persist_file in bash/helpers.sh for how the system works
# Keep this block at the bottom of the file so that any logging from this
# script is only written to file upon initialization! Otherwise workspace-init.log 
# will get written to from this script upon every workspace restart.
